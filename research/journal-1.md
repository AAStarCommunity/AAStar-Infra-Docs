## Abstract

This paper introduces SSI-MedRx, a novel healthcare system leveraging blockchain technology and Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) to address critical issues in current healthcare systems, particularly healthcare fraud, lack of interoperability, and privacy concerns. The authors argue that centralized healthcare data management systems are vulnerable to breaches and do not adequately prevent various forms of fraud, including medical identity theft, phantom billing, kickbacks, and opioid overprescribing. SSI-MedRx proposes a patient-centric approach where individuals control their health data stored in secure digital wallets on their devices. By combining SSI for identity management and authentication with blockchain for tracking non-confidential data like prescription status and payment, the system aims to enhance security, privacy, fraud resilience, and cross-border interoperability in healthcare. A Proof of Concept (PoC) has been implemented to demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of the proposed system.

本文介绍了一种名为 SSI-MedRx 的新型医疗保健系统，该系统利用区块链技术和自主身份 (SSI) 来解决当前医疗保健系统中的关键问题，特别是医疗保健欺诈、缺乏互操作性以及隐私问题。作者认为，中心化的医疗数据管理系统容易遭受数据泄露，并且无法充分预防各种形式的欺诈，包括医疗身份盗用、虚假账单、回扣以及阿片类药物的过度处方。SSI-MedRx 提出了一种以患者为中心的方案，个人可以控制存储在其设备安全数字钱包中的健康数据。通过结合 SSI 进行身份管理和认证，以及利用区块链来跟踪处方状态和支付等非机密数据，该系统旨在提高医疗保健领域的安全性、隐私性、防欺诈能力以及跨境互操作性。已经实施了一个概念验证 (PoC) 来证明所提出系统的可行性和优势。

本文介绍了一种名为 SuperPaymaster 的新型区块链交易Gas支付系统，该系统利用账户抽象（ERC4337）和标准去中心化服务系统 (SDSS) 来解决当前区块链交易的gas支付场景的关键问题，特别是成本高昂、用户体验差以及效率低下问题。作者认为，当下的区块链交易的gas支付极其反人性和不便利，而现有基于ERC4337的gas支付方案依然存在中心化垄断价格和操纵审查的风险。并且无法充分去中心的提供gas支付服务，包括无法接受各种ERC20来支付gas，不能无许可的运行交易gas赞助和支付服务、服务覆盖的不均匀（地域化和市场化，忽略其他地区和某些公链）、以及复杂的应用集成。SuperPaymaster 提出了一种开源去中心的服务方案，任何人可以通过SuperPaymaster合约，注册和运行自己的Paymaster服务，设置接受任何ERC20代币支付gas。通过集成的AirAccount合约和SuperPaymaster服务，以及基于ENS和P2P服务发现网络的SDSS，该系统旨在提高和优化gas支付场景的高昂跨链和持有gas token和支付时间成本、复杂的流程和几十步的操作效率、各种技术概念工具的极差交互的用户体验。已经实施了一个概念验证 (PoC) 来证明所提出系统的可行性和优势。

本文介绍了一种名为 SuperPaymaster 的新型区块链交易 Gas 支付系统，该系统利用账户抽象标准（ERC-4337）和标准去中心化服务系统 (SDSS) 来解决当前区块链交易 Gas 支付场景中的关键挑战，包括高昂的成本、糟糕的用户体验以及低下的效率。作者认为，当前的区块链交易 Gas 支付机制极其不友好且不便利。虽然基于 ERC-4337 的现有 Gas 支付方案在一定程度上有所改进，但仍然面临中心化、价格垄断以及审查风险等问题。此外，现有方案在充分去中心化地提供 Gas 支付服务方面存在不足，具体体现在：无法接受各种 ERC-20 代币支付 Gas；无法实现无需许可地运行交易 Gas 赞助和支付服务；服务覆盖范围不均匀（地域化和市场化倾向明显，忽略了其他地区和某些公链）；以及应用集成过程复杂。SuperPaymaster 提出了一种开源的、去中心化的服务方案，任何人都可以通过 SuperPaymaster 合约注册并运行自己的 Paymaster 服务，并设置接受任何 ERC-20 代币作为 Gas 费用的支付方式。通过集成的 AirAccount 合约和 SuperPaymaster 服务，以及基于 ENS 和 P2P 服务发现网络的 SDSS，该系统旨在显著降低 Gas 支付场景中高昂的跨链和持有 Gas 代币及支付的时间成本，简化复杂的流程，提升低效的多步骤操作，并改善各种技术概念工具带来的糟糕用户体验。已经实施了一个概念验证 (Proof-of-Concept, PoC) 以证明所提出系统的可行性和优势。

This paper introduces SuperPaymaster, a novel blockchain transaction Gas payment system leveraging the Account Abstraction standard (ERC-4337) and a Standardized Decentralized Service System (SDSS) to address critical challenges within the current blockchain transaction Gas payment landscape, including prohibitive costs, suboptimal user experiences, and operational inefficiencies. The authors posit that existing Gas payment mechanisms for blockchain transactions are markedly user-unfriendly and inconvenient. While current solutions based on ERC-4337 have offered partial improvements, they still contend with issues such as centralization, price monopolization, and censorship risks. Furthermore, these existing approaches fall short in providing fully decentralized Gas payment services, evidenced by their inability to accept diverse ERC-20 tokens for Gas fees, the lack of permissionless operation for transaction Gas sponsorship and payment services, uneven service coverage (skewed towards specific geographical areas and prominent blockchains, neglecting others), and complex application integration processes. SuperPaymaster proposes an open-source, decentralized service framework wherein any individual can register and operate their own Paymaster service via the SuperPaymaster contract, with the flexibility to accept any ERC-20 token as payment for Gas. Through the integration of the AirAccount contract and the SuperPaymaster service, underpinned by SDSS utilizing ENS and P2P service discovery networks, this system aims to significantly mitigate the high time costs associated with cross-chain transactions and holding Gas tokens, as well as the time required for payment. It also seeks to streamline cumbersome procedures, enhance inefficient multi-step operations, and improve the poor user experience stemming from various technical conceptual tools. A Proof-of-Concept (PoC) has been implemented to validate the feasibility and advantages of the proposed system.
