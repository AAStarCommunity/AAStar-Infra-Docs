## Abstract

This paper introduces SSI-MedRx, a novel healthcare system leveraging blockchain technology and Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) to address critical issues in current healthcare systems, particularly healthcare fraud, lack of interoperability, and privacy concerns. The authors argue that centralized healthcare data management systems are vulnerable to breaches and do not adequately prevent various forms of fraud, including medical identity theft, phantom billing, kickbacks, and opioid overprescribing. SSI-MedRx proposes a patient-centric approach where individuals control their health data stored in secure digital wallets on their devices. By combining SSI for identity management and authentication with blockchain for tracking non-confidential data like prescription status and payment, the system aims to enhance security, privacy, fraud resilience, and cross-border interoperability in healthcare. A Proof of Concept (PoC) has been implemented to demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of the proposed system.

本文介绍了一种名为 SuperPaymaster 的新型区块链交易 Gas 支付系统，该系统利用账户抽象标准（ERC-4337）和标准去中心化服务系统 (SDSS) 来解决当前区块链交易 Gas 支付场景中的关键挑战，包括高昂的成本、糟糕的用户体验以及低下的效率。作者认为，当前的区块链交易 Gas 支付机制极其不友好且不便利。虽然基于 ERC-4337 的现有 Gas 支付方案在一定程度上有所改进，但仍然面临中心化、价格垄断以及审查风险等问题。此外，现有方案在充分去中心化地提供 Gas 支付服务方面存在不足，具体体现在：无法接受各种 ERC-20 代币支付 Gas；无法实现无需许可地运行交易 Gas 赞助和支付服务；服务覆盖范围不均匀（地域化和市场化倾向明显，忽略了其他地区和某些公链）；以及应用集成过程复杂。SuperPaymaster 提出了一种开源的、去中心化的服务方案，任何人都可以通过 SuperPaymaster 合约注册并运行自己的 Paymaster 服务，并设置接受任何 ERC-20 代币作为 Gas 费用的支付方式。通过集成的 AirAccount 合约和 SuperPaymaster 服务，以及基于 ENS 和 P2P 服务发现网络的 SDSS，该系统旨在显著降低 Gas 支付场景中高昂的跨链和持有 Gas 代币及支付的时间成本，简化复杂的流程，提升低效的多步骤操作，并改善各种技术概念工具带来的糟糕用户体验。已经实施了一个概念验证 (Proof-of-Concept, PoC) 以证明所提出系统的可行性和优势。

英文版：
This paper introduces SuperPaymaster, a novel blockchain transaction Gas payment system leveraging the Account Abstraction standard (ERC-4337) and a Standardized Decentralized Service System (SDSS) to address critical challenges within the current blockchain transaction Gas payment landscape, including prohibitive costs, suboptimal user experiences, and operational inefficiencies. The authors posit that existing Gas payment mechanisms for blockchain transactions are markedly user-unfriendly and inconvenient. While current solutions based on ERC-4337 have offered partial improvements, they still contend with issues such as centralization, price monopolization, and censorship risks. Furthermore, these existing approaches fall short in providing fully decentralized Gas payment services, evidenced by their inability to accept diverse ERC-20 tokens for Gas fees, the lack of permissionless operation for transaction Gas sponsorship and payment services, uneven service coverage (skewed towards specific geographical areas and prominent blockchains, neglecting others), and complex application integration processes. SuperPaymaster proposes an open-source, decentralized service framework wherein any individual can register and operate their own Paymaster service via the SuperPaymaster contract, with the flexibility to accept any ERC-20 token as payment for Gas. Through the integration of the AirAccount contract and the SuperPaymaster service, underpinned by SDSS utilizing ENS and P2P service discovery networks, this system aims to significantly mitigate the high time costs associated with cross-chain transactions and holding Gas tokens, as well as the time required for payment. It also seeks to streamline cumbersome procedures, enhance inefficient multi-step operations, and improve the poor user experience stemming from various technical conceptual tools. A Proof-of-Concept (PoC) has been implemented to validate the feasibility and advantages of the proposed system.

Introduction

Blockchain technology has emerged as a cornerstone of digital innovation, hosting over $3 trillion in on-chain assets. Transactions, the fundamental mechanism for interacting with these assets, are integral to blockchain functionality. However, Ethereum alone incurs daily gas fees exceeding $170 billion (Ultrasound.money), underscoring the critical need to address high costs, complex payment processes, and suboptimal user experiences (UX). These challenges present significant barriers, particularly for new users and mass adoption.

Existing solutions, such as Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-4337 introduced in 2022, have laid a foundation for enhancing transaction mechanisms through the concept of an alternative mempool. This framework introduces components like paymasters, bundlers, and contract accounts, offering a promising model without requiring changes to Ethereum's core protocol. However, notable limitations persist. Current gas sponsorship systems often lack decentralization, leading to monopolistic practices and high costs. Additionally, operational inefficiencies and a steep learning curve, such as managing private keys and acquiring native gas tokens for every chain, hinder broader accessibility and user satisfaction.

To address these challenges, this research focuses on designing and implementing a novel Super Paymaster Contract system. This system introduces a decentralized and competitive gas sponsorship market, significantly reducing costs while simplifying transactional processes. By integrating gas card technology and a cross-chain gas tank mechanism, it minimizes user operations from multiple steps to a seamless experience, enhancing UX and operational efficiency.

The study evaluates the proposed system's impact through empirical testing on Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains. Experimental results demonstrate a 90% reduction in gas costs, sensor-less gas payments, and the consolidation of 15 operational steps into a single streamlined process. While the research is scoped to EVM-compatible chains, its findings aim to establish a scalable framework for addressing key barriers in blockchain transactions.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the relevant literature and current state-of-the-art mechanisms. Section 3 details the methodology, including system design and experimental setup. Section 4 presents the results and comparative analysis. Section 5 discusses implications, limitations, and potential applications. Finally, Section 6 concludes the research, offering insights for future advancements in blockchain gas optimization.





### Introduction 再优化和补充

Background: 提供足够的背景信息来帮助读者理解你的研究领域和研究问题
区块链作为科技尝试改善社会协作关系的新技术，影响范围越来越广，资产规模在起伏中成长到了3万亿甚至更多。根据技术接受模型（TAM, technology acceptance model）和人机交互（HCI, human-computer interaction）的原则，新技术能否被接受并大规模普及，很大程度上取决于用户对新技术的感知以及UX的提升。
从TAM的角度来看，用户会评估技术的感知有用性（他们认为技术能带来多少益处）和感知易用性（他们认为技术使用起来有多容易）。如果用户认为技术的收益大于其付出的成本（包括金钱、时间、精力等），并且使用起来足够便捷，他们更有可能接受并使用这项技术。而从HCI的角度来看，大规模的接受应用，除了直接的经济成本，人与计算机系统交互的效率、用户满意度和技术的易用性、用户体验和有效性和效率等因素也会极大地影响用户对技术的感知价值和接受程度。

Problem Statement: 明确指出你的研究问题或研究假设
迄今为止，仍然没有一个简单易用的区块链账户体系，特别是当下区块链应用的gas支付，是体验最糟糕的一部分：高成本、极其低效、复杂难用，人们甚至没机会评估一个新技术是否安全易用有价值之前就被阻挡在门外。
本研究将探讨如何解决区块链账户gas支付的流程复杂、概念复杂、成本高昂、步骤繁琐、体验不佳的问题，以及中心化机构垄断价格和操纵审查的风险，通过基于账户抽象和标准化去中心化服务系统（SDSS）来解决这些问题。

Research Gap: 描述现有研究中的空白或不足之处，说明你的研究是如何填补这一缺口的
以太坊的账户抽象协议：ERC4337提供了一套解决上述问题的方案，但一方面只是协议而没有实际应用，另外此方案依然存在中心化垄断价格和操纵审查的风险。并且无法充分去中心的提供gas支付服务，包括无法接受各种ERC20来支付gas，不能无许可的运行交易gas赞助和支付服务、服务覆盖的不均匀、以及复杂的应用集成成本。

Research Objectives and Questions: 清晰地阐述你的研究目的、目标或研究问题，这些应该是具体的、可量化的，能够指导整个研究过程
基于ERC4337和其他相关协议，通过提出系统的方案来解决区块链账户的Gas支付问题：认知复杂、操作困难、成本高、步骤多、体验差、安全性差，并且规避当下中心化垄断价格和操纵审查的风险。
新用户完成一次链上交易的认知成本、操作步骤、操作时间、掌握的工具、交互对象、交互流程、支付的成本、易犯错误和安全风险。
当下解决方案的分析：价格垄断、操纵审查风险。

Significance of the Study: 解释为什么你的研究是重要的,它对学术界、行业或社会有何贡献
HCI和TAM的结合，可以为研究提供更全面的视角，帮助我们理解用户对新技术的接受程度和使用体验。从而不但在学术上突破区块链gas支付方案创新，为区块链行业提供更好的真正去中心的gas支付解决探索，而且在实际应用上可以为用户提供更安全、更易用、更低成本、更高效的区块链账户gas支付服务。
去中心是区块链的核心价值，本解决方案构建在SDSS（标准去中心化服务系统）之上，SDSS是本文给出的服务架构。

Scope and Limitations: 定义你的研究范围, 说明研究将涵盖哪些方面,不包括哪些方面,并简要说明这些限制如何影响研究结果
本研究主要关注于区块链账户的Gas支付问题，不涉及其他方面的研究：账户创建、管理、支付、安全、隐私。
Gas支付相关的问题：
1. 认知复杂、操作困难、成本高、步骤多、体验差、安全性差
2. 当下解决方案的分析：价格垄断、操纵审查风险
3. 本文研究的方案：去中心化、竞争、透明、安全、低成本、高效、易用、可信赖

Brief Methodology: 介绍你将使用的研究方法,不需要过于详细,但应足以让读者了解你将如何进行研究
1. 基于ERC4337给出了全新Super Paymaster系统，提供无许可的稳定、安全和竞争的gas支付服务。
2. 提出全新的SDSS来提供基础服务架构，从而保障去中心下安全透明易用基础计算服务。
3. 给出了gas支付创新流程：无感支付gas、社区贡献兑换gas、后付信用支付gas

### Main Themes and Important Ideas

- **Problems with Current Healthcare Systems:** The paper highlights several key vulnerabilities and challenges in existing centralized healthcare systems:
- **Data Fragmentation and Lack of Interoperability:** Different healthcare institutions use incompatible data formats, hindering seamless data exchange, causing delays, miscommunication, and increased costs.
- **Security and Privacy Concerns:** Centralized databases are single points of failure, susceptible to cyberattacks and data breaches, compromising sensitive patient information and leading to medical identity theft.
- **Healthcare Fraud:** The paper details various prevalent healthcare fraud types:
- **Medical Identity Theft:** Illegal use of personal information to receive medical treatment or services, causing financial losses and incorrect medical records.
- **Phantom Billing:** Submitting false claims for services never performed, often involving collusion between providers and pharmacists.
- **Kickbacks:** Financial incentives offered by pharmaceutical companies to healthcare professionals for promoting specific drugs, potentially compromising medical decisions.
- **Opioid Overprescribing:** Excessive prescription of opioids, contributing to the opioid crisis due to misleading marketing and potential kickbacks.
- **Limitations of Existing Countermeasures:** Current measures like e-prescription systems and Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs) have limitations in terms of security, interoperability, and enforcement.
- **The SSI-MedRx Solution:** The paper proposes a decentralized, patient-centric healthcare system based on:
- **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI):** Empowers patients with complete control over their personal and health data, stored in their own digital wallets. This allows them to decide what information to share, with whom, and when.
- "By design, our system empowers patients by granting them complete control over their personal and health data."
- "Thanks to the self-sovereign identity model, SSI-MedRx puts patients at the center of their healthcare journey, fostering a patient-centric approach. It empowers them to engage more proactively in their health situation and decide what information to share, with whom, and when."
- **Blockchain Technology:** Utilized as a public ledger to store non-confidential data, such as prescription status and payment transactions, providing immutability, transparency, and a decentralized consensus mechanism to combat fraud, particularly phantom billing.
- "In contrast, our proposed solution, SSI-MedRx, leverages public blockchain to store non-confidential data necessary to prevent phantom billing frauds."
- **Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and Verifiable Presentations (VPs):** Used for secure and privacy-preserving data exchange between stakeholders. Patient identity, insurance information, prescriptions, and invoices are represented as VCs stored in the patient's wallet.
- **Off-chain Data Storage:** Sensitive personal and health data are stored locally on the patient's devices within their SSI-MedRx wallet, enhancing privacy and reducing the risk of large-scale data breaches.
- **Key Requirements for the Proposed System:** The authors outline critical requirements for designing a fraud-resilient and privacy-preserving healthcare system:
- **Security:** Robust authentication (SSI-based), full control and ownership of data by users, and public verifiability and authenticity of healthcare-related data.
- **Privacy:** Data confidentiality through off-chain storage and auditable consent mechanisms, giving patients control over data sharing.
- **Fraud-Resilience:** Mechanisms to prevent phantom billing (verification of prescription authenticity, consent, and dispensing), kickbacks (prescription by active ingredient), and opioid overprescribing (wallet-based risk assessment).
- **Interoperability:** Adherence to standardized data formats (JSON-LD, JWT) and communication protocols (OpenID for Verifiable Credentials - OID4VC) to enable seamless data exchange between different healthcare entities, even across borders.
- **Borderlessness:** Ability for any verifier to check data validity and authenticity regardless of geographical location, supported by a global governance framework.
- **SSI-MedRx Ecosystem and Trust Model:** The system involves several actors (Governance Authority, Government/Insurance, Healthcare Authority, Patient, Doctor, Pharmacy) and relies on a trust model where verifiers trust the Governance Authority and issuers registered in a Trusted Issuer Registry (potentially on a public blockchain). This framework enables cross-border recognition of verifiable credentials.
- "Thanks to the governance framework, VCs can scale and function effectively within trust communities of any size, ranging from a single state to multiple countries. In SSI-MedRx’s trust model, the verifiers trust governance authority and issuers registered in the Trusted Issuer Registry, which is recorded in the public or public permissioned blockchain."
- **SSI-MedRx Process Workflow:** The paper details the steps involved in the system, including:
- Healthcare professional authentication using their professional ID VC.
- Patient identity verification and prescription issuance by the doctor as a VC, with the patient's wallet checking for potential opioid overprescribing risks.
- Patient's VC verification and payment process at the pharmacy using MedRx tokens (ERC20).
- Issuance of a refund request VC by the pharmacy to the insurance provider.
- Verification of the refund request VP and reimbursement by the insurance, leveraging blockchain to ensure the prescription was dispensed and paid.
- **Implementation Details (Proof of Concept):** The PoC utilizes various technologies:
- Docker and Docker Compose for containerization and orchestration.
- Walt.id's Wallet Kit as the backend framework for managing SSI capabilities and providing reference implementations for verifier and issuer portals.
- Nginx as a reverse proxy.
- Vue.js and Nuxt.js for web portal development.
- Solidity for smart contract development (MedRx Token and SSI-MedRx).
- Metamask for crypto-wallet integration.
- DID:Key method for issuers and patients due to current limitations with did:polygon support in Walt.id APIs.
- Smart contracts on the Polygon test network to enforce anti-insurance fraud policies (payment and refund verification).
- **Countermeasures Against Specific Frauds:** The paper explains how SSI-MedRx addresses each type of healthcare fraud:
- **Medical Identity Theft:** Decentralized data storage, strong SSI-based authentication, and the need for private keys to prove ownership of information make impersonation significantly harder. Challenge policies prevent VP replay attacks.
- **Phantom Billing:** Requiring pharmacies to include the patient's prescription VP in the refund request VC allows insurance companies to verify authenticity and consent. Blockchain tracks prescription status and payment.
- **Kickbacks:** Prescribing drugs by active ingredient empowers patients to choose between generic and brand-name options, reducing the influence of pharmaceutical company incentives on doctors.
- **Opioid Overprescribing:** The patient's SSI-MedRx wallet enforces anti-addiction rules by checking new prescriptions against the patient's history (stored locally) to prevent exceeding safe dosage limits.
- **Privacy Enhancement:** Sensitive data is stored off-chain with patient consent required for sharing. Data exchange is secured through encrypted channels. No personal or sensitive data is stored on the blockchain itself (only metadata and transaction information).
- **Comparison with Related Work:** The paper compares SSI-MedRx with existing blockchain-based healthcare solutions, highlighting its unique combination of public blockchain for specific functionalities and SSI for comprehensive identity and data management, addressing limitations found in other approaches (e.g., private blockchains limiting borderlessness, storage of sensitive data on-chain, lack of robust anti-fraud mechanisms).

### My part
I will follow above as template to write my journal paper main part.

**Problems with Current Gas Payment Systems:** The paper highlights several key vulnerabilities and challenges in existing centralized healthcare systems:
- **Extremely unfriendly to new users:** If you want to launch a normal transfer token transaction or just claim a free NFT, you need to go through a long process of setting up a wallet, connecting to a dapp, and paying gas, especially the gas token buying and payment.
- **Data Fragmentation and Lack of Interoperability:** Different healthcare institutions use incompatible data formats, hindering seamless data exchange, causing delays, miscommunication, and increased costs.
- **Security and Privacy Concerns:** Centralized databases are single points of failure, susceptible to cyberattacks and data breaches, compromising sensitive patient information and leading to medical identity theft.
- **Healthcare Fraud:** The paper details various prevalent healthcare fraud types:
- **Medical Identity Theft:** Illegal use of personal information to receive medical treatment or services, causing financial losses and incorrect medical records.
- **Phantom Billing:** Submitting false claims for services never performed, often involving collusion between providers and pharmacists.
- **Kickbacks:** Financial incentives offered by pharmaceutical companies to healthcare professionals for promoting specific drugs, potentially compromising medical decisions.
- **Opioid Overprescribing:** Excessive prescription of opioids, contributing to the opioid crisis due to misleading marketing and potential kickbacks.
- **Limitations of Existing Countermeasures:** Current measures like e-prescription systems and Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs) have limitations in terms of security, interoperability, and enforcement.
- **The SSI-MedRx Solution:** The paper proposes a decentralized, patient-centric healthcare system based on:
- **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI):** Empowers patients with complete control over their personal and health data, stored in their own digital wallets. This allows them to decide what information to share, with whom, and when.
- "By design, our system empowers patients by granting them complete control over their personal and health data."
- "Thanks to the self-sovereign identity model, SSI-MedRx puts patients at the center of their healthcare journey, fostering a patient-centric approach. It empowers them to engage more proactively in their health situation and decide what information to share, with whom, and when."
- **Blockchain Technology:** Utilized as a public ledger to store non-confidential data, such as prescription status and payment transactions, providing immutability, transparency, and a decentralized consensus mechanism to combat fraud, particularly phantom billing.
- "In contrast, our proposed solution, SSI-MedRx, leverages public blockchain to store non-confidential data necessary to prevent phantom billing frauds."
- **Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and Verifiable Presentations (VPs):** Used for secure and privacy-preserving data exchange between stakeholders. Patient identity, insurance information, prescriptions, and invoices are represented as VCs stored in the patient's wallet.
- **Off-chain Data Storage:** Sensitive personal and health data are stored locally on the patient's devices within their SSI-MedRx wallet, enhancing privacy and reducing the risk of large-scale data breaches.
- **Key Requirements for the Proposed System:** The authors outline critical requirements for designing a fraud-resilient and privacy-preserving healthcare system:
